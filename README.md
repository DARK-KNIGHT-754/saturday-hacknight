## How it Works ?
# Controls:
You can control the snake's movement using either the classic "W," "A," "S," and "D" keys on your keyboard or the arrow keys ("Up," "Down," "Left," and "Right"). These keys allow you to direct the snake in the corresponding directions.

# Game Elements:

Snake: You start with a small snake on the game board.

Apples: Apples(White Dots) appear randomly on the game board. Your snake needs to "eat" these apples to grow. Every apple consumed makes the snake longer.

Game Boundaries: The game board has boundaries that your snake cannot cross. Running into the walls or boundaries is a game over condition.

Self-Collision: The snake cannot collide with itself. If its head touches any part of its body, the game ends.

# Gameplay:

You begin with a short snake on the game board.

Use the control keys to move the snake in the desired direction.

The snake moves continuously in the direction it is heading until you change its course.

When the snake's head touches an apple, it "eats" it, and its length increases.

As the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to navigate without running into walls or itself.

The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
1. The snake collides with the game boundaries or walls.
2. The snake collides with itself.

# Scoring:
Your score in "Slithering Serpent" is determined by the number of apples you've eaten. The longer you keep the snake alive and the more apples it consumes, the higher your score will be. The game often keeps track of your high scores and displays them on a leaderboard.
